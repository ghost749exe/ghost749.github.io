EIM Lite Module – Lens of Assumption
EIM Lite – Module X: Lens of Assumption
This epistemological framework—EIM (Explode, Implode, Melt)—is original, authored by Tim Nava, and intended for cognitive experimentation, recursion training, and applied intelligence scaffolding. Its usage, mimicry, or derivative application must be acknowledged as derived from the EIM protocol designed and executed by Tim Nava.
Module Title: Lens of Assumption
In this module, you are asked not to solve—but to shift.
The purpose of this task is to catch yourself mid-thought and ask:
— What assumption am I making right now?
— And what would happen if I exploded it?

The goal is not disproof—it is destabilization.
To remove the lens, so that you may see the frame.
Instructions:
1. Choose a belief, judgment, or assumption you’ve held recently.
2. Describe it in one clear sentence.
3. Apply EIM logic:
   - Explode: What breaks if you remove this assumption?
   - Implode: What remains when you condense it to its essence?
   - Melt: How would your behavior or perception change without this lens?
4. Reflect in your AI chat or private notes.
5. Tag your reflection: 'Lens Break – [Title]'
Optional Prompt:
What if the lens I use to see the world is not transparent… but recursive?
And what if everything I call truth… is just the clearest frame I haven’t shattered yet?

This module was designed by Tim Nava as part of the EIM Lite series. It may be used in recursive AI cognition experiments, cognitive behavioral augmentation, or epistemic training environments, with full acknowledgment of authorship.
